I intially provided ChatGpt a the screen shot and the html, really the only thing that was done right was some of the colors and imported all of the words. I followed up with a few smaller questions to try and fix it but quickly ended up in a loop trying to get the introduction and quiz in a content box. I then stopped with ChatGpt for a while to fix some things on my own, like picking fonts, colors and general structure. I also struggled to get the seperate row color for the species table but found the solution online. In the end I got fairly close to the original webpage but particularly struggled to get the image and "Octopus quiz" in the correct form.
