Nothing changed, look at the screen shot again to understand the style I am describing

ChatGPT: 

It seems that the structure hasn't fully reflected the intended design from the screenshot. Let me refine the styling and structure to ensure the layout precisely matches the provided screenshot.

Here are the updates I'll implement:

1. Wrap the introduction, amazing facts, anatomy, and quiz into a single white box, mimicking the contained look from the screenshot.

2. Adjust the padding, margin, and alignment to ensure consistent spacing and positioning.

Here is the updated CSS:
Edited

that's still wrong put the introduction and quiz section in a singular white container exactly like the one you used for species table

ChatGPT: 

Edited

You: 

how can I color just the second row of the species table white

ChatGPT: 

To color just the second row of the species table white, you can use the `nth-child` CSS pseudo-class to target the second row (`tr:nth-child(2)`) of the table. Here's how you can do it:

```css
#species-table table tr:nth-child(2) {
    background-color: white;
}
```

Add this CSS rule to your stylesheet, and it will specifically target the second row of the species table and set its background color to white. Let me know if you want me to include this in your document!

You: 

I've given you a mostly corrected version of the CSS now

ChatGPT: 

It looks like the CSS has been refined significantly already. To color just the second row of the species table white, you need to target it correctly. Here's how you can update the relevant part of your CSS:

Replace this rule:


```css
#species-table table tr:nth-child(3) {
    background-color: white;
}
```

With:


```css
#species-table table tr:nth-child(2) {
    background-color: white;
}
```

This change ensures the second row is specifically targeted. Let me know if you'd like me to make any other updates or clarifications!
